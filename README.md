# Description
In this project, I worked as an analytics consultant for a movie reviews company to analyze movie budgets, ratings, and release trends from 2007 to 2011 using the Movie-Ratings.csv dataset. The analysis includes visualizing movie budgets across genres over time, examining the correlation between audience and critic ratings, analyzing the number of movies released by genre each year, and comparing ratings trends over time. Additionally, the study highlights the budget allocation of the top 3 movies based on both audience and critic ratings, segmented by genre, to understand high-performing movies and investment patterns.
